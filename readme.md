- [ ] LO1 Examine the key components related to the objectorientated programming paradigm, analysing design pattern types
- [ ] M1 | Determine a design pattern from each of the creational, structural and behavioural pattern types.
- [ ] D1 | Analyse the relationship between the object-orientated paradigm and design patterns.

#### LO2 Design a series of UML class diagrams
- [ ] P2 | Design and build class diagrams using a UML tool.
- [ ] M2 | Define class diagrams for specific design patterns using a UML tool.
- [ ] D2 | Analyse how class diagrams can be derived from a given code scenario using a UML tool.

#### LO3 Implement code applying design patterns 
- [ ] P3 | Build an application derived from UML class diagrams
- [ ] M3 | Develop code that implements a design pattern for a given purpose.
- [ ] D3 | Evaluate the use of design patterns for the given purpose specified in M3.

#### LO4 Investigate scenarios with respect to design patterns
- [ ] P4 | Discuss a range of design patterns with relevant examples of creational,  structural and behavioural pattern types.
- [ ] M4 | Reconcile the most appropriate design pattern from a range with a series  of given scenarios.
- [ ] D4 | Critically evaluate a range of design patterns against the range of given  scenarios with justification of your choices.
